## How can I contribute?

### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues][Issues].

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Mindsers/yabf/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Write new unit test(s) that match the bug case to limit future regression.

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please ensure your code follow the code convention.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

* Please ensure that your changes does not include regression.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

## Styleguides

### JavaScript styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style][Styleguide].

Exepctions to Standard style:

* We do not want space after function name `function name(arg) { ... }`

Additional rules:

* Prefer spread operator (`prefer-spread`)
* No useless brackets for arrow functions (`arrow-body-style`)
* No useless parens for arrow functions (`arrow-parens`)
* Require space before/after arrow functionâ€™s arrow (`arrow-spacing`)
* `switch` must have a default case (`default-case`)
* `for...in` loop must be guard by an `if` (`guard-for-in`)
* Require space before the star of generator function (`generator-star-spacing`)
* Getter properties must return a value (`getter-return`)
* Compare to `-0` is an error (`no-compare-neg-zero`)
* Use brackets if arrow function body could be confused with comparisons (`no-confusing-arrow`)
* No `else` when return is used (`no-else-return`)
* No empty block statements (`no-empty`)
* No type conversion with shorter notations (`no-implicit-coercion`)
* No useless `return` statement (`no-useless-return`)
* No redeclare variables (`no-redeclare`)
* Using `var` statement is an error (`no-var`)
* Prefer arrow function for callback (`prefer-arrow-callback`)
* Prefer using constant (`prefer-const`)
* Prefer rest parameter (`prefer-rest-params`)
* Prefer using template literals (`prefer-template`)

All the rules are listed in `.eslintrc.json` on the root directory.

### TypeScript styleguide

All TypeScript code must be as close as possilbe to JavaScript code. So, the rules follow the [JavaScript Standard Style][Styleguide] too plus some rules that only apply to TypeScript.

All the rules are listed in `tslint.json` on the root directory.

### Git commit messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").

* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").

* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.

* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
