**Yet Another Basic Framework** for NodeJS.

It is a learning experience: I wouldn't use expressjs as usual but learn how to make/code dependency injection, routing, http requests, and other development patterns/paradigms/concepts by myself.

It can be use as a base for server projects. Of course so much things are missing and you will have to develop it yourself or create an issue in this repo.
